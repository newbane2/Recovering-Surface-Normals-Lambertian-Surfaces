Task is to develop a vision system that recovers the orientation and 
reflectance of an objectâ€™s surface using photometric stereo. 
You are given 3 images of an object taken using three different light sources. 
First compute the light sources directions and intensities from 4 images of a
sphere and use this information in the second part to recover the orientation and 
reflectance. Then compute the surface normals and albedo for this object.

To compile run use makefile with makeall.

to run s1
./s1 {input original image} {input threshold value} {output parameters file}
./s1 sphere0.pgm 90 s1_out.txt

to run s2
./s2 {input parameters file} {image 1} {image 2} {image 3} {output directions file}
./s2 s1_out.txt sphere1.pgm sphere2.pgm sphere3.pgm s2_output.txt

to run s3
./s3 {input directions} {image 1} {image 2} {image 3} {step} {threshold} {output}
./s3 s2_output.txt object1.pgm object2.pgm object3.pgm 10 85 s3_out.pgm

to run s4
./s4 {input directions} {image 1} {image 2} {image 3} {threshold} {output}
./s4 s2_output.txt object1.pgm object2.pgm object3.pgm 85 s4_out.pgm

Equation for part b:
Normal Vector = [(Xb-Xc) (Yb - Yc) (Zb - Zc)]' (' being transform)
You can solve for Z using the equation
(Zb-Zc)^2 = sqrt(r^2 - (Xb-Xc)^2 - (Yb-Yc)^2)
